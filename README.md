# BPI++4
## BPI++4 (Basic PC Information++) is an app that gives you basic info about your PC and doesn't waste your resources. <br/> <br/> 
## A ton of useless info ahead:<br/><br/>
# Why? X program is better than this crap.
## I know. I just wanted to make one for myself, for **me** my own programs look better than the other ones and since I made them myself it's easier to edit and fix mistakes. <br/><br/>

# Download and install guide
## If you want to use it, just grab an EXE from the releases. If you want to mod/ you don't trust me you can download the source code and compile from there but be careful since there is something you need to define before you compile it:
* # You need to define an environment variable called "wxwin" with the value being "path\to\wxWidgets\3.1.5"
* # The wxWidgets should be x64.

# - MODDING GUIDE -
## Now I don't expect nobody to mod this crap but here is a way to add stuff to it which I use (It's too self-explanatory, it doesn't even need a guide):<br/> <br/>


## Use (From "Samples" filter in Visual Studio): <br/> <br/>
* # NoThreadFrameSample.h 
* # SampleThreadFrame.h
## Use both respectively for your threading and non-threading needs. <br/><br/>
